# My-Daily-Python-Practice
My daily Python practice to improve problem-solving and coding skills — one step at a time.
# 🐍 Daily Python Practice

This repository is my personal learning journal for Python.

Every day, I update this repo with:
- What I learned 📚
- What I practiced 💻
- Small scripts or notes 📝

## 🎯 Purpose
To stay consistent, motivated, and keep track of my coding journey, one day at a time.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure
Each folder is named by day (`day01`, `day02`, etc.) and contains:
- Python files I wrote
- A short note or comment inside the code about what I learned
- 
## ✍️ My Style
- No fixed topics — I follow my interest and pace
- I commit to what I understood and practiced that day
- Some days may be simple, some more advanced — all are part of the journey

## 🚀 Why This Matters
- Tracks my progress
- Helps me reflect and review
- Builds a habit of writing code daily
